# Flight Control

A few years ago, I decided to take my software skills into the physical world. I hacked some [Arduino](http://arduino.cc)-based projects together—circuits, some code, and plastic enclosures I bought from a supplier.

With the help of the [Big Cartel Employee Art Grant](https://www.bigcartel.com/team/#art-grants), I’m learning how to 3D print so I can design, prototype, and build my own enclosures for electronic projects.

First up, controllers for [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com) and [X-Plane](http://www.x-plane.com).

I’m up and running with my [Big Cartel Employee Art Grant](https://www.bigcartel.com/team/#art-grants) project. The 3D printer has arrived, and the first practice prints came out well.

I’ve been in the thick of my [Big Cartel Employee Art Grant](https://www.bigcartel.com/team/#art-grants) project for the past few months. I’ve been sourcing components, working on various mounts and enclosures, and designing the final product.

After [putting together a component test unit](https://acolangelo.com/blog/component-tests), I hooked it up to a [Teensy++ 2.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html)—the brains of the controller—and took it for a spin in X-Plane.
